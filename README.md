# AgeClicker
Project: Age-Clicker
Date: 12/5/2019

Assignment Instructions: create an android application with a text that changes when clicked.
The text displayed corresponds to human ages "New Born" -> "Child" ..etc as explained
Once the text gets to the last age, it restarts and gets back to the first level.

Functionality: User clicks the text and it updates to the next human age.
Also initiates a pop up to let the user know that the text has been clicked.
This continues until the human ages repeat which prompts the counter at the bottom to increment.

Implementation: Used an array to cycle through the different human ages.
Implemented a nested if statement for the counter-logic.
